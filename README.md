> There is a proxy server written in Node Js which helps us prevent CORS errors when making API calls to our crypto backend.
> Without it, Chrome was throwing CORS errors and there is no way to fix this in client side. So i wrote a server from scratch to deal with it.

## Initial Setup
  - (**HARD REQUIREMENT**) To run this project, make sure you have ```node js``` installed on your system.
  - Second,(*assuming you are inside the root of the project folder*) run ```npm i``` to install all the dependencies.
  - (Not a hard rule) You must have ```make``` utility by **GNU** installed on your system to build and run this project.
  - If you **DO NOT** have ```make``` installed, then you can just use this command to directly run the project without it:
      - ```npm run dev-with-server```
  - If you have ```make``` installed on your system, just run:
    -  ```make serve```
